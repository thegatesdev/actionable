Archiving some old plugin projects...

Actionable was a support library Minecraft plugin for reading customizable 'actions', 'conditions' and 'event reactors' from confiruration files.
It event worked for a brief moment ;]
This concept is still in the works somewhere else, archiving this repo because it is a mess.
